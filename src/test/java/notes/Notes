Tagging Concept:
When you tag @Smoke or @Regression, either scenarios with Smoke or Regression tag found will be executed
When you tag @Smoke and @Regression, then scenarios where cucumber finds both of these tags will be executed
When you tag "not @Smoke", this will skip scenarios which are tagged Smoke, but will execute the scenarios other than Smoke

Prerequisites:
Preerequisite scenarios are scenarios execute first before executing remainder of the scenarios. Because you want to initiate web browsers etc. you want
this step to be executed before you execute another codes.
