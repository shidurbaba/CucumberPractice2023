Serialization and Deserialization with POJO Classes in API Testing

In the context of API testing with Rest Assured, serialization refers to the process of converting a Java object into a request body, also known as the payload. Conversely, Rest Assured supports deserialization, which is the transformation of a response body back into a Java object.

Benefits:

Utilizing Java objects for serialization and deserialization offers the advantage of simplified parsing and extraction of JSON or XML responses.
Creating Java methods that interact with these objects enhances code readability.
Design Strategy:

Java objects are constructed utilizing POJO (Plain Old Java Object) classes.
These POJO classes are designed in alignment with the structure of the request and response data.
Required Additional Libraries:

For handling JSON data, it's necessary to include libraries such as Jackson, Jackson2, Gson, or Johnzon in your classpath.
For XML data processing, the JAXB library is required.
